            <h3>Introduction</h3>
        </center>
            <hr>
            <p  style="text-align: justify;">Clinical knowledge management is the discipline concerned with the collection, processing, visualisation, storage, preservation, and retrieval of health related data and information, whether on an individual patient or a clinical specialty. Its successful adoption into daily clinical practice requires the use of new technologies such as: electronic health records; standardised medical terminologies, tools and methods to support speedier retrieval and dissemination of clinical information; and reliable networks to facilitate electronic communication in “real time.” Recent advances in Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) have facilitated the development of mobile communications, offering the opportunity for integration into existing and planned clinical information systems, and offer solutions for data capture and information retrieval at the point of care. Hidden organisational and cultural complexities arise from the anticipated use of ICTs, such as training needs, clinical acceptance, and a shift in empowerment within the patient-clinician relationship towards the patient. Addressing these issues requires commitment, application and tenacity from all stakeholders involved in the healthcare process.</p>
            <p  style="text-align: justify;">The management of any clinical condition has traditionally been viewed as a clinician’s domain. Data collection and information dissemination is still seen in some places as the preserve of an individual clinician with little evidence of sharing clinical knowledge. However, this established model of care in the UK is now being replaced by patientcentred care in which the patient is viewed as an equal partner in the care process. The Department of Health (DH) is committed to bringing together patients, carers and clinicians to create informal and formal relationships that support the self-management of chronic conditions. The DH also recognises this shift in responsibility for healthcare provision in its publication of documents such as “The Expert Patient” (Department of Health, 2001a). The “NHS Plan” (Department of Health, 2001b) developed from consultations with patients, is committed to the development of ‘high quality patient-centred care’ along with the development of modern ICT systems in primary and secondary care. It acknowledges the effective role that patients can play in the effective management of chronic diseases. Key elements of patient-centred care include, a patient’s right to have access to their own medical records, access to identified and appropriate clinicians for treatment, access to information relating to waiting times, information on adverse drug effects and care planning, and the expectation that clinicians will keep accurate and accessible healthcare records. Patient knowledge is recognised as a beneficial asset to the healthcare process and as such is becoming a valuable tool in terms of the management of chronic conditions. In the specific area of management of chronic diseases, the opportunity to capture home-based data offers patients, carers and clinicians the possibility to add value in terms of increasing knowledge to manage the care process more effectively and as a consequence, empower key stakeholders in the healthcare experience.</p>

            <h3>Clinical Records Management</h3>
            <hr>
        </center>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">A medical record relating to an individual patient is a collection of information that relates to distinct episodes of care. In the past, medical records were associated with one particular GP Practice or secondary healthcare organisation. In the early days of the NHS, patient notes were exclusively hand-written. Recipients of the information complained that they could not read handwriting, the information contained in the document was not always appropriate to the clinical need at that moment, and that too many documents did not reach the intended recipient in time to be of use for planning of ongoing treatment and care. Medical records such as the “Lloyd George” paper folder can still be found in daily use in some primary healthcare organisations. The transition to an electronic healthcare record is not quite complete, as issues such as scanning of paper notes and training staff to use computers is claimed to be an impediment to progress. Both issues require resource allocation that is not always seen as a priority in organisations with limited resources that exist in an environment of constant change.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">As far as clinical records management is concerned, prior to the introduction of an electronic healthcare record, all documents relating to an individual patient remained with the originating organisation. Clinical information was collected and recorded by both nurses and doctors for use within one clinical domain. The main problem with paper note keeping in secondary care was ensuring that the patient notes were in the right place at the right time and in a format in which people could easily retrieve information required.</p>
        <center>
            <h3>Electronic Care Records</h3>
            <hr>
        </center>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Roll out of electronic healthcare records in the UK is currently underway. In 1998 the NHS launched an IT strategy, “Information for Health” (1998), that aimed to link all GPs withthe NHS’s own intranet, NHSnet, and to procure basic electronic records for all hospitals and healthcare communities. Financial planning, interest in clinical outcomes data, and computer support for clinical decision making at the point of care are examples of some of the original key drivers that led to this development. To expedite progress of this IT initiative, a national programme for NHS IT (NPfIT) has been created ( National Programme for Information Technology). The programme has developed a new vision of an integrated care records service (ICRS) which will be designed around patients rather than institutions, and will be accessible 24 hours a day, seven days a week. An electronic clinical noting system reflects a degree of flexibility in order to provide clinicians with the ability to retrieve clinical information in a format that they require. Certain items of information that relate to the patient (such as name and address) that lie outside the scope of clinical information should always appear in the same place in all clinical documents.Electronic healthcare records that can be shared between staff seem like an obvious solution to support clinical knowledge management; although their potential goes far beyond that of recording clinical information.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">NPfIT is setting national standards to ensure that clinicians are provided with real-time access to information, which allows them to share patient and relevant documents with other clinicians and allied health professionals. A key concept in this change is that patient information will cross organisational boundaries allowing documents relating to clinical care, care in the community and social care to be integrated. This concept relies on the establishment of best practice in knowledge management. By 2010, it is envisaged that every NHS patient in England will have an electronic healthcare record that they will be able to access via the Internet regardless of location. To support the key drivers and enable successful integration into the healthcare process, electronic healthcare records must be web-based, and be web-enabled allowing interaction with Internet technologies such as web services.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">The current situation regarding clinical note keeping in the NHS shows that communication between organisations remains sketchy and fragmented. The technology is available to support communication across organisational boundaries, however it is fair to say that not all secondary healthcare organisations are as advanced as primary care in their adoption of ICT to support clinical note keeping. Integration of primary, secondary and tertiary healthcare electronic healthcare records is a prerequisite of the practice of clinical knowledge management. Failure to link systems to enable seamless transfer of clinical information between relevant organisations will create a situation little different to that brought about by existing paper based systems.</p>

                <h3>Opportunities for Supporting Clinical Care: Integrated Drug Delivery</h3>
                <hr>
        </center>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">The development of home-based drug delivery systems offers the opportunity to capture data relating to the use of a device by a patient, collect data to support the assessment of clinical conditions, as well as empowering patients to become more involved in the management of chronic conditions. The data captured by a drug delivery device can be used to create useful information for both clinicians and patients/carers. Care should be taken to ensure that the information generated is about the right person, stored in a medium that is accessible to all who are nominated to use the system, and delivered at the right time to any specified delivery device, such as mobile phones, palmtops as well as desktop PC’s. A critical element to the successful integration of informatics into the device must be commitment by all stakeholders, at all stages from development, implementation through to adoption into daily use.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Data integration from electronic healthcare record systems is essential in order to achieve state of the art clinical communication between stakeholders. The data collected must be able to be represented in a ubiquitous format that is acceptable to all those who take part in the care process. Critical elements in successful adoption of a home based drug delivery system into daily clinical use include the identification of the right data, the creation of the right structure, and the integration into the right clinical processes to add value. The care of asthmatic patients will be used to exemplify issues associated with home-based delivery of clinical treatment. If the above elements are addressed then the information architecture developed can be transferred to any clinical condition thatrequires delivery of drugs to the lungs.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Technology can support the diffusion of healthcare to the home through the development of home-based drug delivery systems. However, patient use of these systems may reveal issues that alter the traditional patient/clinician relationship. For example, clinicians who are not specialist in asthma may be confronted with patients who are considerably more knowledgeable about their condition. Acceptance and adoption into daily care will only be achieved through detailed and thorough integration into clinical practice, along with rigorous evaluation of the impact ICT has upon the care process. The effect of cultural issues will require assessment and evaluation and will influence adoption of novel approaches to patient centred care.</p>
